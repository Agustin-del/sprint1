                    <h3>General Information</h3>
                    <p> 
                           The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing<br>
                        Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a<br>
                        member of MDHL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in Chicago northside<br>
                        neighborhood. MDHL ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of<br>
                        parents and previous league members.
