                                    a given maximum and minimum width and length. The dimension should be
                                    addered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.</li>

                                minimum requirements must advice the State Competition Board which will
                                assign it Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
                                whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
                                from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
                                field may be required to play all their games away.
